			<center><p class="cell">In this class, we made connections to the other project elements by connecting the themes of the Industrial Revolution to aspects of today and through working in groups on our own models on revolutionary inventions. This part of study was the source of the inspiration for the content in the Humanities 10/Yearbook mixed media collages and became a part of this website as a result to connect all three subjects into a fully codeed website with links and more. Click the images below of the sketch or model of "our invention" for the full resolution images on the aspects of our project's steps. Click on the opening slide for our full presentation slides on our company invention and what we contributed to the project individually in our groups.</p></center>
