						<p class="cell">Coding the Past is a grand project with which we work with many alternating classes such as cascading stylesheet, working on photoshop, and interviewing older people to know more about their history. It is a hands on experience in exploring the past, making artistic collages to represent them, and making a website that proceeds to expand on the topics. To learn more about the artistic collages we did to influence a stronger impact in people's history, please look into Noel's class for the following. If you would like to see what we did and learned in our interviews about our subject's life so far, please check Daramola's class for the following. Click on the following and labeled links below to navigate through topics on the following pages and to learn more about the topics and what we've done so far in the semester.</p>
