				<p class="cell">In Yearbook, we worked with photoshop to establish many aspects of history into some format of art through using many different layers of a photo for a whole piece to be made from it. This piece and itâ€™s layers are meant to represent something on our interviewee such as their emotions, past events, and more. Click on the image of my dad to see the full picture resolution of the final image of his self-portrait.</p>
				<p class="cell"> Click on the image with the word design for an audio to be played, this audio's name is: complex feelings on my own existence ft. jungkook. I thought the theme fit into existence fitting into your past and even the future, which was essentially what the project asked for. Complex feelings had to do with my interviewee's feelings on events in the past such as the 9/11 attack.</p>
				<p class="cell">Click on any of the following images for my reflection on the portrait so see what I conveyed about my piece, what I felt about it, and more.</p>
